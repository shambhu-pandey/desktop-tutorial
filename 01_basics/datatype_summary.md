# primitive  and non primitive data types 

- Mutability: Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned. Non-primitive data types are mutable and can be modified. Storage: Primitive data types are stored directly in memory, whereas non-primitive data types are stored as references to their values in memory


** primitive datatypes are : number , boolean , string , bigint , symbol null , undefined  **

non primitive : array , object , function ;

```let num = 123;
let str = " shambhu"
let number = 12345678233467n;
let isLogged = true;
let email = null;
let pass= undefined;

 console.table([num , str , number , isLogged , email , pass])```
